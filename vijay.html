Deverakonda Vijay Sai (born 9 May 1989), professionally known as Vijay Deverakonda,[1] is an Indian actor and film producer who works predominantly in Telugu films.[2][3] One of the highest-paid actors of Telugu cinema, he has featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list since 2018 and has received several accolades, including a Filmfare Award, a Nandi Award, and three SIIMA Awards.[4]

Deverakonda made his debut with Nuvvila (2011) and received praise for his supporting role in the coming-of-age drama Yevade Subramanyam (2015). He rose to prominence as a leading film actor by starring in Pelli Choopulu (2016) and Arjun Reddy (2017), winning the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance as a volatile surgeon in the latter. He further established himself with commercially successful films such as Mahanati (2018), Geetha Govindam (2018), and Taxiwaala (2018).[5][6] This success was followed by a series of poorly received films, with the exception of Kushi (2023).
